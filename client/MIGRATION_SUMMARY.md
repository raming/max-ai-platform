# Web Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from broken `web` setup to fresh Next.js 15.5.4 + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui setup.

## What Was Done

### ✅ Phase 1: Setup
1. **Archived old web** - Renamed `client/web` → `client/web-old` to preserve all original code
2. **Created fresh project** - Used `create-next-app` with latest Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind v4
3. **Initialized shadcn/ui** - Configured with neutral color scheme
4. **Verified setup** - Confirmed fresh install works with test buttons
5. **Renamed** - `web-new` → `web` to restore original naming

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Ported
- ✅ Entire `/lib` directory (ports, adapters, auth, middleware, etc.)
- ✅ `middleware.ts` - Next.js middleware
- ✅ `app/layout.tsx` - Updated with React Query provider
- ✅ `app/global.css` - Global styles
- ✅ Installed `@tanstack/react-query` and dev tools

### ✅ Phase 3: API Routes Ported
- ✅ `/app/api/*` - All API routes (webhook, auth, resources, IAM, token-proxy, etc.)
- ✅ `/app/ingress/*` - All ingress routes (payments, GHL, retell, twilio)

### ✅ Phase 4: Pages and Components Ported
- ✅ `/app/onboarding/*` - Entire onboarding flow
- ✅ `page-from-old.tsx` - Original home page (preserved for reference)
- ✅ `/specs` - Specification files
- ✅ `/tests` - Test suites

### ✅ Phase 5: Configuration
- ✅ `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- ✅ `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with workspace paths
- ✅ `tsconfig.spec.json` - Test TypeScript configuration  
- ✅ `jest.config.ts` - Jest test configuration
- ✅ `project.json` - NX project configuration

## Build Status
✅ **Build succeeds!** `npm run build` completes successfully

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
The build has some ESLint warnings about `any` types:
- `app/api/hello/route.ts` - 2 warnings
- `app/api/webhook/*` - Multiple warnings in route and tests
- `app/ingress/*` - Warnings in route handlers
- `lib/adapters/supabase-provider.ts` - 2 warnings
- Various test files - `any` type usage

**Note**: These are style warnings, not errors. The build completes successfully despite them.

### Edge Runtime Warning
- `lib/audit/audit-writer.ts` uses Node.js `fs` module which isn't supported in Edge Runtime
- This is a known limitation; the file may need refactoring if used in Edge contexts

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application**
   - Run `npm run dev` and test all routes
   - Verify onboarding flow works
   - Test API endpoints
   
2. **Clean up ESLint warnings** (optional but recommended)
   - Replace `any` types with proper TypeScript types
   - Use proper type assertions where needed
   
3. **Review and update main page**
   - Decide whether to keep `page-from-old.tsx` content or the test buttons
   - Merge desired content into `app/page.tsx`

4. **Optional: Remove web-old**
   - Once confident everything works, can delete `client/web-old`
   - Or keep it as archive for reference

## Structure Comparison

### Old (web-old)
- Next.js (version unknown, had configuration issues)
- Tailwind CSS (broken configuration)
- shadcn/ui (partial/broken)

### New (web)
- ✅ Next.js 15.5.4
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4
- ✅ shadcn/ui (fresh install)
- ✅ TypeScript 5.x
- ✅ React Query for data fetching
- ✅ All original business logic and routes preserved

## Files Preserved in web-old
The entire original `web` folder is preserved as `web-old` for reference:
- All original code
- All original tests
- All original configuration
- Can be safely deleted once migration is verified

## Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@tanstack/react-query": "latest",
  "@tanstack/react-query-devtools": "latest",
  "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.1",
  "clsx": "^2.1.1",
  "lucide-react": "^0.545.0",
  "tailwind-merge": "^3.3.1"
}
```

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Fresh Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui setup
- ✅ All business logic ported
- ✅ All API routes ported
- ✅ All pages and components ported
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Original code preserved in web-old
