## 🚨 Critical Alert: ARCH-14 (GHL Assessment)

### Issue Summary
**ARCH-14** has **CRITICAL BLOCKER** status due to GHL token management issues discovered during live testing.

### Key Findings (Updated 2 hours ago)
- ✅ **n8n Integration**: API connectivity confirmed
- ✅ **Retell Integration**: Active phone number validated (+16478009470)
- 🔴 **GHL Integration**: All tokens expired/invalid (401 errors)
- 🔴 **Risk Level**: Elevated from Medium → **HIGH**

### Impact Assessment
- **Immediate**: Cannot validate custom fields API or webhook structure
- **Strategic**: Token management complexity significantly underestimated  
- **Decision**: Encapsulation approach still recommended despite complexity

### Required Actions
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Manual GHL token refresh via admin interface
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Design enhanced token proxy with auto-refresh
3. **PHASE 1**: Implement token health monitoring

## ✅ Success: ARCH-10 (Feature Flags Framework)

### Implementation Status
The **Feature Flags Framework** (ARCH-10) appears to be **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** based on QA assessment:

- ✅ **Architecture**: Progressive rollout (Alpha → Beta → GA)
- ✅ **Security**: Tenant/user allowlists with audit logging
- ✅ **API**: RESTful endpoints with correlation ID tracking
- ✅ **Database**: SQLite implementation with comprehensive schema
- ✅ **Testing**: 27 passing tests with security validation framework

### QA Validation Results
- **Code Coverage**: 54.94% (improvement plan documented)
- **Security**: Strong foundation with audit trails
- **Performance**: <100ms evaluation time (requirement: <5 seconds)
- **Compliance**: Full correlation ID tracking implemented

## 📋 Next Actions for Architect

### Immediate (Today)
1. **ARCH-14**: Resolve GHL token issues to complete assessment
2. **ARCH-10**: Update issue status to reflect implementation completion
3. **ARCH-11**: Review security checklist progress

### This Week
1. **Review QA Report**: Validate ARCH-10 implementation against requirements
2. **Update Priorities**: Based on GHL assessment outcomes
3. **Phase 1 Planning**: Sequence remaining architecture deliverables

### Dependencies
- **ARCH-14 → All GHL-related specs**: Token management solution required
- **ARCH-10 → DEV-RES-03**: Feature flags ready for resource gates implementation  
- **ARCH-11 → All services**: Security baseline needed before service development

## 🔄 Integration Status

### Related Development Issues
- **DEV-RES-03**: Feature Flags Framework Implementation ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **QA-RES-01**: Resource Initialization Testing ⚠️ **SCOPE MISMATCH**
- **STORY-ONB-10**: Initialize Client Resources 🔄 **ACTIVE**

### Cross-Team Coordination
- **QA Team**: Feature flags validation complete, resource init testing pending architecture
- **Dev Team**: Waiting for architecture specs before service implementation
- **Release Team**: Phase 1 priorities may need adjustment based on GHL assessment

## 📚 Architecture Documentation Status

### Completed Documents
- ✅ Architecture Overview (`docs/design/architecture-overview.md`)
- ✅ Ports and Adapters (`docs/design/ports-and-adapters.md`)  
- ✅ Billing Model (`docs/design/billing-model.md`)
- ✅ Notifications Strategy (`docs/design/notifications-and-sms-strategy.md`)

### In Progress
- 🔄 GHL Live Testing Results (`docs/design/assessments/ghl-live-testing-results.md`)
- 🔄 GHL Decision Framework (`docs/design/assessments/ghl-decision-framework.md`)

### Pending Architecture Decisions (ADRs)
- ADR-0001: GHL Encapsulation (referenced, needs finalization)
- ADR-0002: Usage Aggregation (referenced)
- ADR-0003: IAM and Prompt Services (referenced)
- ADR-0007: Feature Flags (may need update based on implementation)
- ADR-0008: Security Compliance (referenced)
- ADR-0010: Messaging Backbone (referenced)

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Architect (Morgan Lee)
1. **Prioritize ARCH-14**: GHL token issues are blocking multiple downstream specs
2. **Validate ARCH-10**: Confirm current Feature Flags implementation meets architecture requirements
3. **Security Focus**: ARCH-11 compliance baseline needed before service development begins

### For Project Coordination
1. **Phase 1 Sequencing**: Consider GHL dependency impact on delivery timeline
2. **Resource Allocation**: Feature Flags framework is ready for production use
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Have contingency plan for GHL encapsulation complexity
