# Phase 3 Plan — Scale, Observability, and Costing

Goals
- Harden multi-tenant scale, rate limits/quotas; advanced observability and cost accuracy

Scope and links
- Architecture: ../design/architecture-overview.md
- Billing: ../design/billing-model.md
- ADR-0002: ../adr/adr-0002-usage-aggregation.md
- ADR-0004: ../adr/adr-0004-payments-gateway-agnostic.md

Milestones
1) Scale: quotas per tenant/client; backpressure controls; queue sizing and DLQ policies
2) Observability: tracing across adapters; log redactors; audit dashboards
3) Usage collectors: Twilio + OpenRouter expanded; automated reconciliation; anomaly detection
4) Analytics: per-agent and per-client KPIs; export APIs
5) Security/compliance: PII minimization, consent tracking; data retention policies

Acceptance criteria
- Sustained load tests pass SLOs; throttle works without data loss
- Reconciliation pipeline flags anomalies; mean time to detect < 15m
- Audit and tracing provide end-to-end correlation for a representative flow

Risks and mitigations
- Cost spikes → anomaly alerts and autoscaling guardrails
- Vendor outages → circuit breakers and graceful degradation

Handoffs
- TL to open performance, observability, and reconciliation stories
