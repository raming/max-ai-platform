# M1 Supabase Resource Assessment for Multi-Client Deployment

## Executive Summary

For M1 milestone "Initialize Client Resources (Supabase KB)", we need to evaluate Supabase project quotas and resource limits to support multi-client resource initialization where each client gets dedicated Supabase prompts/documents tables.

## Current M1 Scope

Based on STORY-ONB-10 and phase-1.md specifications:
- **Goal**: Initialize per-client resources including Supabase project (guided/manual or API) and required tables (prompts, documents)
- **Input**: client_id, resource params  
- **Output**: ResourceInitializationPlan executed; resource links stored
- **Implementation**: Resource provisioner (Supabase), token proxy in api-gateway
- **Security**: No secrets in logs; manual steps supported; resume plan execution

## Supabase Quotas Analysis

### Free Tier Limitations
- **Database**: 2 projects, 500 MB database, unlimited API requests
- **Auth**: 50,000 monthly active users per project  
- **Storage**: 1 GB per project
- **Edge Functions**: 500,000 invocations per project
- **Realtime**: 2 concurrent connections per project

### Pro Tier ($25/project/month)
- **Database**: Unlimited projects, 8 GB included database, unlimited API requests
- **Auth**: 100,000 monthly active users per project  
- **Storage**: 100 GB per project
- **Edge Functions**: 2M invocations per project
- **Realtime**: 500 concurrent connections per project

### Team/Enterprise Tiers
- Custom pricing with dedicated resources
- Higher limits and SLA guarantees
- Advanced security and compliance features

## M1 Deployment Strategy

### Option 1: Single Shared Supabase Project (Recommended for M1)
**Approach**: One Supabase project with tenant isolation via client_id partitioning

**Pros**:
- Lower cost ($25/month vs $25/client/month)
- Simpler secrets management (one set of keys via token proxy)
- Easier monitoring and maintenance
- Sufficient for M1 MVP validation

**Cons**: 
- Less isolation between clients
- Shared resource limits
- Migration complexity if switching to per-client projects later

**Resource Limits Assessment**:
- **Database**: 8GB should support 50-100 clients with moderate prompt/document usage
- **API Requests**: Unlimited sufficient for M1 testing
- **Storage**: 100GB adequate for document storage across clients

### Option 2: Per-Client Supabase Projects  
**Approach**: Dedicated Supabase project per client

**Pros**:
- Complete tenant isolation
- Independent scaling per client
- Easier compliance (HIPAA, SOC2) if needed
- Clear billing attribution

**Cons**:
- High cost ($25/client/month minimum)
- Complex secrets management (multiple project keys)
- Management overhead (monitoring N projects)
- API rate limits for project creation

## Recommended M1 Implementation

### Phase 1 (M1): Shared Project with Tenant Isolation
```json
{
  "strategy": "shared-project",
  "supabase": {
    "tier": "Pro",
    "projects": 1,
    "cost_monthly": 25,
    "tables": {
      "prompts": {
        "partition_key": "client_id",
        "expected_rows_per_client": 100,
        "estimated_storage_per_client": "1MB"
      },
      "documents": {
        "partition_key": "client_id", 
        "expected_rows_per_client": 500,
        "estimated_storage_per_client": "50MB"
      }
    }
  },
  "capacity": {
    "max_clients_m1": 50,
    "database_headroom": "6GB remaining",
    "monitoring_required": ["db_size", "api_requests", "concurrent_connections"]
  }
}
```

### Security via Token Proxy
- Supabase keys stored securely in api-gateway
- Client requests proxied through our API (no direct Supabase access)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce client_id isolation
- Audit logging for all resource access

### Migration Path to Per-Client Projects (Post-M1)
- Data export/import utilities
- Gradual migration for enterprise clients
- Dual-mode support during transition

## Resource Monitoring and Alerts

### Critical Metrics
- Database size utilization (alert at 80% of 8GB)
- API request rates per client
- Connection pool utilization
- Storage usage growth rate

### Scaling Triggers
- **Database**: Upgrade to Team tier or migrate high-usage clients
- **Connections**: Implement connection pooling or upgrade tier
- **Storage**: Archive old documents or upgrade storage limit

## Cost Analysis

### M1 Costs (Shared Project)
- Supabase Pro: $25/month
- Estimated 10 test clients: $2.50/client/month
- Total monthly: $25 + operational overhead

### Alternative (Per-Client Projects)
- 10 clients Ã— $25/month = $250/month
- 10x cost increase for M1 MVP

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Database Size Limit
- **Mitigation**: Document archival strategy, monitoring alerts
- **Escalation**: Upgrade to Team tier if approaching limits

### Risk: Shared Resource Contention  
- **Mitigation**: Connection pooling, query optimization
- **Escalation**: Migrate high-usage clients to dedicated projects

### Risk: Tenant Data Isolation
- **Mitigation**: RLS policies, comprehensive testing
- **Escalation**: Switch to per-client projects for compliance-sensitive clients

## Recommendations for Release Manager

1. **Approve shared Supabase project approach for M1** - balances cost and complexity
2. **Provision Supabase Pro tier** - provides adequate headroom for testing  
3. **Implement resource monitoring dashboard** - track utilization proactively
4. **Plan migration strategy** - document path to per-client projects for Phase 2
5. **Test RLS policies thoroughly** - ensure complete tenant isolation
6. **Configure backup and disaster recovery** - protect client data

## Next Steps

- [ ] Provision Supabase Pro project for M1
- [ ] Configure token proxy in api-gateway 
- [ ] Implement RLS policies for client_id isolation
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Test ResourceInitializationPlan execution
- [ ] Document operational runbooks
