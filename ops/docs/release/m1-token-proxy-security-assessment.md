# M1 Token Proxy Security Assessment for Supabase Resource Management

## Executive Summary

This document assesses the security posture of the token proxy integration in api-gateway for secure Supabase resource access in M1 milestone, ensuring secrets management compliance with observability requirements (no secrets in logs).

## Current Architecture (Based on Specifications)

### Token Proxy Design (per iam.md and architecture-overview.md)
- **Location**: api-gateway service (apps/api-gateway NestJS)
- **Function**: Store provider tokens server-side; perform operations on behalf of users
- **Security Principle**: Never expose provider tokens to browser/client
- **Token Rotation**: Integration with secrets manager; audit token issuance/revocation

### Resource Access Flow

```

## Security Controls Assessment

### ‚úÖ Compliant Controls (per ADR-0008 and security-compliance.md)

#### 1. Secrets Management
- **Implementation**: Supabase keys stored in api-gateway secrets manager
- **Access**: Only api-gateway has direct access to provider tokens
- **Rotation**: Token rotation capabilities with audit trail
- **Compliance**: ‚úÖ Meets "no secrets in logs" requirement

#### 2. Audit Logging
- **Coverage**: All resource access operations logged
- **Format**: Structured logs with tenant_id, client_id, correlation_id
- **Redaction**: Enforced centrally - no secrets/PHI in logs
- **Compliance**: ‚úÖ Meets observability audit requirements

#### 3. Access Controls
- **RBAC**: Resource access gated by IAM policy checks
- **Scoping**: Service accounts scoped by tenant
- **Verification**: Policy check endpoint validates {subject, action, resource}
- **Compliance**: ‚úÖ Meets least privilege principles

#### 4. Encryption and Transport
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **At Rest**: Provider keys encrypted in secrets storage
- **Compliance**: ‚úÖ Meets encryption requirements

### üî∂ Areas Requiring Implementation Verification

#### 1. Token Storage Security
**Requirement**: Secure storage of Supabase project keys (anon + service role)
- **Assessment**: Depends on secrets manager implementation
- **Recommendation**: Use managed secrets service (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- **Verification Needed**: Confirm encryption at rest and access controls

#### 2. Key Rotation Policy
**Requirement**: Regular rotation of Supabase service role keys
- **Assessment**: Framework defined but rotation schedule needs specification
- **Recommendation**: Monthly rotation with zero-downtime key rollover
- **Verification Needed**: Test key rotation without service interruption

#### 3. Request Correlation and Audit
**Requirement**: Full audit trail for resource initialization operations
- **Assessment**: Architecture supports correlation IDs and audit hooks
- **Recommendation**: Ensure ResourceInitializationPlan execution fully logged
- **Verification Needed**: Validate audit events for all Supabase operations

## M1 Implementation Security Checklist

### High Priority (P0) - Must Have for M1
- [ ] **Secrets Manager Integration**
  - [ ] Supabase keys stored in secure secrets manager (not environment variables)
  - [ ] Access controls configured (only api-gateway can read keys)
  - [ ] Encryption at rest enabled

- [ ] **Token Proxy Implementation**
  - [ ] api-gateway proxies all Supabase requests
  - [ ] Zero direct client access to Supabase endpoints
  - [ ] Request authentication and authorization working

- [ ] **Audit Logging**
  - [ ] All resource operations logged with correlation IDs
  - [ ] No secrets in log output (verified with test cases)
  - [ ] Audit events include: actor, action, resource, tenant_id, client_id

### Medium Priority (P1) - Should Have for M1
- [ ] **Key Rotation**
  - [ ] Automated key rotation capability implemented
  - [ ] Graceful key rollover without service interruption
  - [ ] Audit trail for key rotation events

- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**
  - [ ] Failed authentication attempts monitored
  - [ ] Unusual access patterns detected
  - [ ] Key rotation failures alerted

### Lower Priority (P2) - Nice to Have
- [ ] **Advanced Security**
  - [ ] Rate limiting per client/tenant for resource operations
  - [ ] Geographic access restrictions if needed
  - [ ] Integration with SIEM/security monitoring

## Security Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Token proxy correctly handles Supabase authentication
- Secrets are never logged or exposed in responses
- Policy checks prevent unauthorized resource access
- Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information

### Integration Tests  
- End-to-end ResourceInitializationPlan execution with audit trail
- Key rotation doesn't disrupt active operations
- Cross-tenant isolation verified (client A cannot access client B resources)

### Security Tests
- Penetration testing of token proxy endpoints
- Secrets scanning in codebase and logs
- Compliance validation for audit log format

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk - Immediate Attention Required
**Risk**: Direct client access to Supabase bypassing token proxy
- **Impact**: Credential exposure, unauthorized access
- **Mitigation**: Network-level restrictions, comprehensive testing
- **Owner**: Development team

**Risk**: Secrets logged during debugging or error conditions  
- **Impact**: Credential compromise, compliance violation
- **Mitigation**: Thorough log redaction testing, security code review
- **Owner**: Development team

### Medium Risk - Monitor and Plan Mitigation
**Risk**: Insider access to secrets manager
- **Impact**: Potential credential misuse
- **Mitigation**: Audit all secrets access, implement break-glass procedures
- **Owner**: SRE/Operations team

**Risk**: Key rotation failures causing service outage
- **Impact**: Service interruption, manual intervention required
- **Mitigation**: Robust key rotation testing, rollback procedures
- **Owner**: SRE/Operations team

## Compliance Validation

### PCI SAQ A Compliance
- ‚úÖ No direct cardholder data processing (Supabase stores business data only)
- ‚úÖ Secure token handling prevents credential exposure
- ‚úÖ Webhook verification for payment-related callbacks

### HIPAA-like Controls (if PHI processed)
- ‚úÖ Access controls and audit logging in place
- ‚úÖ Encryption in transit and at rest
- ‚ö†Ô∏è BAA with Supabase required if PHI stored in documents tables

### General Security Compliance
- ‚úÖ Least privilege access principles
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive audit logging
- ‚úÖ Encryption requirements met
- ‚úÖ Structured security controls framework

## Recommendations for Release Manager

### Immediate Actions (Pre-M1 Release)
1. **Verify secrets manager implementation** - ensure Supabase keys properly secured
2. **Conduct security code review** - focus on token proxy and log redaction
3. **Execute security test suite** - validate no secrets exposure scenarios
4. **Document incident response** - procedures for key compromise scenarios

### Post-M1 Hardening
1. **Implement automated key rotation** - reduce manual security operations
2. **Enhanced monitoring** - security-focused observability dashboard
3. **Regular security audits** - quarterly review of token proxy security
4. **Compliance documentation** - maintain security control documentation

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test secrets redaction in logs
grep -r "anon_key\|service_role" logs/ && echo "SECURITY ISSUE: Found keys in logs"

# Verify token proxy endpoints don't expose credentials
curl -v /api/resources/init | grep -i "supabase.*key" && echo "SECURITY ISSUE: Keys in response"

# Test cross-tenant isolation  
# (Client A trying to access Client B resources should fail)
```

## Sign-off Criteria

For M1 release approval, Release Manager must verify:
- [ ] **No secrets in logs** - comprehensive testing confirms log redaction works
- [ ] **Token proxy functional** - all Supabase access goes through secure proxy  
- [ ] **Audit trail complete** - resource operations fully logged with correlation IDs
- [ ] **Cross-tenant isolation** - clients cannot access other tenant resources
- [ ] **Security tests pass** - automated security test suite validates controls
- [ ] **Documentation complete** - security runbooks and incident procedures ready

## Conclusion

The M1 token proxy architecture provides a solid security foundation for Supabase resource management. The key risk areas are implementation details around secrets management and log redaction. With proper implementation and testing, this approach meets the security and compliance requirements for M1 milestone deployment.
