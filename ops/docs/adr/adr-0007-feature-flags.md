**Status**: Approved  
**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Authors**: architect.morgan-lee  
**Reviewers**: [To be assigned by team lead]

## Context

The MaxAI platform requires a robust feature flag system to enable safe progressive delivery of new features, particularly for UI/UX changes, beta functionality, and experimental capabilities. The system must support multi-tenant architecture with tenant-level and user-level feature assignments while maintaining high performance and reliability.

### Business Requirements
- **Progressive Rollouts**: Support alpha → beta → GA progression
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Per-tenant feature enablement with inheritance
- **User-Level Overrides**: Individual user assignments for testing
- **Environment Awareness**: Different behaviors across dev/staging/prod
- **Audit and Compliance**: Complete audit trail for feature access
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms evaluation for up to 50 concurrent flags
- **Safety**: Default-enabled behavior for missing flags (GA assumption)

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Nx monorepo structure
- PostgreSQL database requirement
- React/Next.js client integration required
- RESTful API design for third-party integration
- Must support caching for performance
- Server-side evaluation for security

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive feature flags framework with the following architectural decisions:

### 1. Data Architecture Decision

**Chosen Approach**: Multi-table normalized design with separate assignment tables

```sql
Tables:
- feature_flags (core flag definitions)  
- feature_flag_tenant_assignments (tenant-level overrides)
- feature_flag_user_assignments (user-level overrides)
- feature_flag_evaluation_logs (audit trail)
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single table with JSONB assignments (rejected: complex queries, poor performance)
- NoSQL document store (rejected: ACID requirements, existing PostgreSQL infrastructure)
- External SaaS (rejected: data sovereignty, cost, integration complexity)

**Rationale**: 
- Normalized design provides optimal query performance for evaluation logic
- Separate assignment tables enable efficient indexing and caching strategies
- PostgreSQL constraints enforce data integrity at the database level
- Clear separation of concerns for different assignment scopes

### 2. Evaluation Engine Decision

**Chosen Approach**: Priority-based evaluation with explicit precedence rules

```
Evaluation Priority (highest to lowest):
1. User-specific assignment
2. Tenant-specific assignment  
3. Global flag configuration
4. Default behavior (true for missing flags)
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Complex rule-based engine (rejected: over-engineering, maintenance burden)
- Percentage-based rollouts (deferred: Phase 2 requirement)
- External evaluation service (rejected: latency, complexity)

**Rationale**:
- Simple precedence rules are easy to understand and debug
- Predictable behavior reduces operational complexity  
- User assignments enable precise testing scenarios
- Default-enabled behavior follows "missing flag = GA" principle

### 3. Caching Strategy Decision

**Chosen Approach**: In-memory LRU cache with 1-minute TTL and pattern-based invalidation

```typescript
Cache Key Format: ff:{flag_key}:{tenant_id}:{user_id}:{environment}
TTL: 60 seconds (configurable)
Eviction: LRU with 10,000 entry limit
Invalidation: Pattern-based (e.g., "ff:my-feature:*")
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redis external cache (rejected: added infrastructure complexity)
- Database-level caching (rejected: insufficient granular control)
- No caching (rejected: performance requirements)

**Rationale**:
- In-memory cache provides sub-millisecond access times
- Pattern-based invalidation enables precise cache control
- 1-minute TTL balances performance with consistency
- LRU eviction prevents memory exhaustion

### 4. API Design Decision

**Chosen Approach**: RESTful API with separate evaluation and management endpoints

```
Management API (admin):
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/feature-flags/*

Evaluation API (runtime):  
POST /api/v1/feature-flags/evaluate
GET /api/v1/feature-flags/config
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GraphQL API (rejected: REST sufficient for use case)
- Single evaluation endpoint (rejected: performance optimization needs)
- Streaming/WebSocket updates (deferred: Phase 2 consideration)

**Rationale**:
- Separate concerns between management and evaluation
- GET /config optimized for client-side consumption
- POST /evaluate provides detailed server-side evaluation
- RESTful design enables easy third-party integration

### 5. Client Integration Decision

**Chosen Approach**: React Context + Hooks pattern with TanStack Query

```typescript
// Provider pattern for app-wide state
<FeatureFlagsProvider>
  <App />
</FeatureFlagsProvider>

// Hook-based consumption  
const { isEnabled } = useFeatureFlags();
const enabled = useFeatureFlag('my-feature');

// Component-based gating
<FeatureGate flagKey="my-feature">
  <NewFeature />
</FeatureGate>
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux/Zustand global state (rejected: over-engineering for read-only data)
- Direct API calls per component (rejected: performance, consistency issues)
- Server-side rendering only (rejected: client-side interactivity needs)

**Rationale**:
- Context provides clean dependency injection
- Hooks enable simple consumption patterns
- TanStack Query handles caching and background updates automatically
- Component gates enable declarative feature gating

### 6. Nx Integration Decision

**Chosen Approach**: Dedicated app + shared libraries following Nx conventions

```
client/
  apps/
    feature-flags/                    # NestJS service
  libs/
    shared/feature-flags/            # Core logic, types
    ui/components/                   # React components
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single shared library (rejected: violates separation of concerns)
- External microservice (rejected: Nx integration requirements)
- Integration into main API (rejected: service boundary clarity)

**Rationale**:
- Dedicated app enables independent deployment and scaling
- Shared libraries promote code reuse across applications
- Follows established Nx patterns for consistency
- Clear boundaries between server and client concerns

### 7. Governance and Lifecycle Decision

**Chosen Approach**: State machine with approval workflows

```
States: draft → alpha → beta → ga → deprecated → removed
Approvals: Role-based with minimum approval counts
Lifecycle: Automated expiry enforcement with notifications
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual lifecycle management (rejected: operational burden)
- No approval workflow (rejected: governance requirements)
- External approval system (rejected: integration complexity)

**Rationale**:
- State machine prevents invalid transitions
- Role-based approvals ensure proper oversight
- Automated expiry prevents flag accumulation
- Clear lifecycle promotes operational discipline

## Implementation Plan

- **Logging**: Structured logs with correlation IDs
- **Alerting**: Flag evaluation failures, expired flags, approval delays  
- **Dashboards**: Real-time flag usage and performance metrics

## Migration Strategy

### Existing Features
- No existing feature flags system to migrate
- New implementation from scratch following specification

### Future Considerations  
- **Phase 2**: Percentage-based rollouts, A/B testing integration
- **Phase 3**: Machine learning-based rollout optimization
- **Integration**: External feature flag service compatibility layer
