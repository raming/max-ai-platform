# ARCH-LOG â€” 2025-10-05

Purpose
Mirror conversation outcomes and decisions; not a source of truth for tasks (Issues are), but resilient if session closes.

Summary of decisions
- Adopt Nx monorepo with services listed in architecture-overview
- Platform-agnostic ports/adapters for CRM/Calendar/Payments/Message
- Payment gateway agnostic: Stripe + PayPal adapters; cost-plus + included + overage
- Declarative flow schema with n8n fallback; webhook-ingress normalization
- GHL domain encapsulation via proxy; avoid direct embed unless safe
- Notifications: internal for critical, n8n for process; SMS via Twilio or GHL or n8n

Open questions
- Which payment provider to implement first (Stripe vs PayPal) for MVP?
- Which calendar to prioritize (Google vs Microsoft)?
- Next CRM adapter after GHL (HubSpot or Dynamics)?

Next actions (Phase 1)
- See docs/release/phase-1.md for milestones and acceptance criteria
- Prepare GH Issues for ARCH-02..ARCH-07 using tracker/specs/ARCH-PLAN.md bodies
