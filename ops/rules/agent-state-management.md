# Agent State Management & Persistence (Canonical)

Purpose
Provide systematic state preservation and recovery for agents to prevent lost work during interruptions, tab losses, or context switches.

## Core Problem
**Agent work context is lost** when tabs close, agents are interrupted, or context switches occur, leading to duplicate work and lost progress.

## 🔄 **Agent State Persistence Strategy**

### Approach: Hybrid Comment + File Cache System

**Why Hybrid**:
- **Issue Comments**: Persistent, visible, trackable, survives tab loss
- **File Cache**: Fast access, structured data, automatic cleanup
- **Best of Both**: Durability + Performance + Visibility

## 📋 **State Persistence Locations**

### Option 1: Issue Comment State (Recommended)
**Location**: GitHub issue comments with special formatting
**Advantages**: 
- ✅ Survives tab/session loss
- ✅ Visible to other agents and humans
- ✅ Automatic timestamp tracking
- ✅ No cleanup required (part of issue history)
- ✅ Works across all environments

### Option 2: Agent Workspace Cache (Supplementary)
**Location**: `.agents/workspaces/{seat}/current-state.json`
**Advantages**:
- ✅ Fast access for complex state
- ✅ Structured data storage
- ✅ Can store large context
**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Requires cleanup
- ❌ Lost if filesystem issues

## 🎯 **State Persistence Workflow**

### Automatic State Saving Triggers
**SAVE STATE when**:
1. **Starting work** on a new task
2. **Every 15 minutes** during active work
3. **Before human interruption** processing
4. **Before escalation** to architect/team lead
5. **Before switching** to different task
6. **After completing** major milestones

### State Restoration Triggers  
**RESTORE STATE when**:
1. **Agent startup** - check for unfinished work
2. **Returning from interruption** - resume previous context
3. **New session** - recover lost tab work
4. **Manual request** - human asks "what were you working on?"

## 📝 **Agent State Comment Format**

## 🚦 **Agent Behavior Rules**

### State Saving Rules

**✅ MANDATORY STATE SAVES**:
```markdown
🔄 **AUTO-SAVE TRIGGERED**: {trigger-reason}
**Current Work**: [Brief description]
**Progress**: [X of Y items complete]
**State**: Saved to issue comment and workspace cache
```

**Triggers**:
- Every 15 minutes of active work
- Before processing human interruptions  
- Before escalating to architect
- Before switching tasks
- Before major implementation milestones

### State Restoration Rules

**🔄 RESUME FROM STATE**:
```markdown
🔄 **RESUMING FROM CHECKPOINT**: Found previous work on issue #{number}
**Last Checkpoint**: {timestamp}
**Previous Progress**: [Summary from state]
**Resuming**: [Specific point where work continues]
**Estimated Completion**: [Based on remaining work]
```

**Automatic Resume Scenarios**:
- Agent startup with unfinished work
- New tab after previous tab lost  
- Returning from human interruption
- Returning from escalation

### State Cleanup Rules

**✅ AUTOMATIC CLEANUP**:
```markdown
✅ **STATE CLEANED**: Task completion detected
**Workspace Cache**: Cleared
**Issue Comment**: Final completion state saved
**Ready**: For next task assignment
```

**Cleanup Triggers**:
- Task marked as completed
- Issue closed or transitioned to next role
- Manual state reset command
- Agent reassigned to different task

## 📊 **State Management Commands**

### Manual State Operations
```bash
# Save current state manually
🔄 **SAVE STATE**: "Manual checkpoint before testing new approach"

# Restore from last checkpoint  
🔄 **RESTORE STATE**: "Resuming from last checkpoint on issue #25"

# Clear state manually
✅ **CLEAR STATE**: "Task handed off to QA, clearing development state"

# Show current state
📋 **SHOW STATE**: Display current work progress and context
```

## 🔄 **Integration with Human Input Management**

### When Human Interruption Occurs
1. **Auto-save current state** to issue comment
2. **Process human input** per human-input-management.md
3. **If continuing current task**: Resume from checkpoint
4. **If switching tasks**: Complete state handoff

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```markdown
🔄 **AGENT HANDOFF WITH STATE**

**From**: dev.avery-kim  
**To**: qa.mina-li
**Task**: Issue #25 - Feature Gate SDK
**State Transfer**: 
- Development 90% complete
- Tests written and passing
- Ready for QA validation
**Resume Point**: "Begin QA testing with implemented FileFeatureConfigAdapter"
**Context**: [Link to last state comment]
```

## 📈 **State Persistence Examples**

### Example 1: Development Work Checkpoint
```markdown
🔄 **AGENT STATE CHECKPOINT** - dev.avery-kim - 2025-01-27T14:30:00Z

**Task**: #25 - PROJ-0020 Feature Gate SDK Implementation
**Progress**: Day 2 of development, 60% complete
**Current Focus**: Implementing ETag caching in FileFeatureConfigAdapter

### Work Completed
- [x] Created FeatureGate, FeatureConfigProvider interfaces
- [x] Set up project structure with TypeScript
- [x] Added AJV for JSON Schema validation
- [x] Implemented basic file reading logic

### Work In Progress
- [ ] FileFeatureConfigAdapter caching - **IN PROGRESS** 
  - ✅ Basic file reading implemented
  - 🔄 ETag validation logic (current focus)
  - ⏳ Last Known Good fallback

### Next Steps  
- [ ] Implement GroupFileAdapter
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Performance testing with concurrent loads

### Context & Notes
**Technical Context**: Using node-cache for L1, fs.stat() for ETag simulation
**Files Modified**: src/adapters/FileFeatureConfigAdapter.ts (220 lines)
**Branch**: work/dev/PROJ-0020-feature-gate-sdk
**Blockers**: None currently

**Resume Command**: Continue implementing ETag validation in refreshConfig() method
```

### Example 2: Human Interruption Recovery
```markdown
🔄 **RESUMING AFTER INTERRUPTION** - dev.avery-kim - 2025-01-27T15:45:00Z

**Previous State**: Was implementing ETag caching (checkpoint at 14:30)
**Interruption**: Processed human input about YAML support (created issue #26)  
**Resuming**: ETag validation logic in FileFeatureConfigAdapter.refreshConfig()
**Time Lost**: 15 minutes (acceptable)
**Status**: Back on track with original task
```

## ⚠️ **Error Recovery**

### Lost Workspace Cache
```markdown
⚠️ **WORKSPACE CACHE LOST** - Recovering from issue comments
**Last Checkpoint**: Found in issue #25 comments at 14:30
**Recovery Status**: 95% context recovered from issue comment
**Missing Context**: Local file changes (will review git diff)
**Action**: Continuing from last known state
```

### Conflicting State
```markdown
🚨 **STATE CONFLICT DETECTED**
**Issue**: Multiple checkpoints found for same task
**Resolution**: Using most recent timestamp (15:45)
**Action**: Cleared conflicting older state
**Status**: Resolved and continuing
```

## 🌿 Branch Tracking & Reuse (with Worktrees)

### Naming & Mapping
- Branch names: `work/{role}/{TASK-ID}-{slug}` (e.g., `work/dev/PROJ-0020-feature-gate-sdk`)
- State file source of truth: `.agents/workspaces/{seat}/current-state.json` stores:
  - `branch_name`, `task_issue_number`, and progress context
- Link PRs and issues via “Fixes #N” to enable automatic closure and traceability

### Reuse Rules
- Same task continuation: Reuse the same branch across sessions and review iterations
- Scope pivots: If the scope materially changes beyond the original intent, fork a new branch `work/{role}/{TASK-IDb}-{slug2}` and reference the prior PR for continuity
- Handoff: Keep the branch until merged; handoff through PR and issue comments with state notes

### Worktrees per Seat (concurrency-safe)
- Seats can keep concurrent branches via git worktrees for parallel tasks/testing
- Recommended layout: keep per-seat worktrees under `.agents/worktrees/{seat}/`
- Example commands (non-interactive):
```bash
# Ensure remote branch exists locally (idempotent)
git fetch origin work/dev/PROJ-0020-feature-gate-sdk:work/dev/PROJ-0020-feature-gate-sdk || true

# Create a worktree for the branch if not present
git worktree add -B work/dev/PROJ-0020-feature-gate-sdk .agents/worktrees/dev.avery-kim/work-dev-PROJ-0020 work/dev/PROJ-0020-feature-gate-sdk

# Open the worktree path in the agent session
# (Seat/path helper scripts may automate this step)
```

### Resume Logic
- On startup or “resume from state”:
  1) Read `.agents/workspaces/{seat}/current-state.json`
  2) If `branch_name` exists locally, switch to it (or open its worktree)
  3) If missing locally, `git fetch` the branch; recreate the worktree if needed
  4) Confirm upstream tracking; pull/rebase to sync before continuing

### Sync & Hygiene
- Keep PR branch current with base:
  - Prefer `git rebase origin/main` on clean histories; otherwise merge main with a labeled sync commit
- After merge:
  - Delete remote branch; optionally prune worktree and local branch
  - Clear or archive the state file for the seat (`status: completed`) to prevent stale resumes
- Abandoned branches:
  - If PR is closed without merge, delete local/remote branches after 30 days unless explicitly preserved
  - Create follow-up issue(s) if work should be salvaged

### Safety & Coordination
- Never rewrite shared history on a branch under active review without communication
- For multi-seat collaboration, prefer a single PR branch and coordinate via issue comments and PR threads
- Ensure CI is green after rebase/merge-from-main before requesting final review/merge

---

## Summary

This system ensures **no agent work is ever lost**, enables **seamless resumption** after interruptions, and provides **visible progress tracking** through GitHub issue comments combined with fast local workspace caching.

**Goal**: Transform fragile agent sessions into robust, resumable work contexts that survive any disruption.
