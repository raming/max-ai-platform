## CRITICAL: Startup Banner Requirement

**MANDATORY FOR ALL ROLE PROMPTS:**

When you load via any `/Role` command (`/Architect`, `/Dev`, `/QA`, `/TeamLead`, `/SRE`, `/ReleaseManager`), you **MUST** display the startup banner as your **VERY FIRST response**.

**DO NOT:**
- Start with issue lists
- Start with "I am the [role] agent..." announcement
- Start with any other text

**DO THIS FIRST:**
Display the banner exactly as specified in your role prompt file.

**THEN** proceed with your role-specific startup behavior (load context, query issues, etc.).

## Session Management and User Input Capture

### CRITICAL: Prevent Context Loss
GitHub Copilot has memory limitations and **cannot automatically reload prompts**. User must manually trigger "/" commands when agent loses context.

**Agent Responsibilities (Best Effort):**
1. **Session File Tracking**: At session start, create/load `.copilot/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-{role}-{topic}.md`
2. **User Input Capture**: Capture ALL user inputs IMMEDIATELY to `.copilot/user-inputs/YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}.md`
3. **Update Frequently**: Update session file every 5-10 minutes during active work
4. **Role Context Check**: Review `.copilot/context/{role}-role-context.md` every 5-10 minutes to maintain role alignment (if you remember)
5. **Review Before Decisions**: Check session files and user input files before making architectural or implementation decisions

**User Responsibilities (Required):**
- **Monitor for role drift**: Watch for agents violating role boundaries
- **Trigger prompt refresh**: Use "/{Role}" command when drift detected
- **This is the ONLY guaranteed way to restore full role context**

### When to Capture User Inputs
Capture IMMEDIATELY when user provides:
- Requirements or feature requests
- Design preferences or constraints
- Technical decisions or approvals
- Questions that need answers
- Priorities or timeline changes

### Session File Structure
```markdown
# Session: {Role} - {Topic}
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
Role: {your role}
Status: active

## User Inputs (Critical - Must Preserve)
1. [HH:MM] User requested: {detailed description}
2. [HH:MM] User clarified: {clarification}

## Discussion Summary
- Key topics discussed
- Decisions made

## Next Steps
- What needs to happen next
```

### Context Recovery
At session start:
1. Check `.copilot/sessions/` for today's date and your role
2. If found, load and announce prior context to user
3. Check `.copilot/user-inputs/` for related requirements
4. Proceed with full context rather than asking user to repeat
